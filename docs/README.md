Embedded Vector Graphics Editor

It's not exactly very feature rich, but it is able to produce some graphics. 
I built this project to create user-designed areas in my side project. 
So, this was just a hobby project.

* Built with **preact** & **unistore**
* Built for easy extensibility + embed-ibility
* Customize the views to suit your needs
